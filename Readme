VoiceGPT – AI Voice Chatbot
Project Description

VoiceGPT is an intelligent voice-based chatbot that allows users to interact with AI using natural spoken language. It integrates OpenAI GPT API, speech-to-text (STT), and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, enabling a fully voice-enabled conversational experience. Users speak their messages, which are converted to text, processed by GPT, and then read aloud for a hands-free AI interaction.

Features

Voice Input (STT): Convert spoken words into text.

AI Response Generation: Human-like responses via OpenAI GPT-3.5/4.

Voice Output (TTS): Read AI responses aloud.

Conversation Memory: Maintains context for better replies.

Cross-Platform: Works on web browsers and can be adapted for mobile.

Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python Flask

AI Model: OpenAI GPT API

Speech Recognition: OpenAI Whisper API or Web Speech API

Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3, gTTS, or browser TTS API

Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Heroku/AWS (backend)

Installation & Setup
Backend

Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Set your OpenAI API key in .env:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Run the backend server:

python app.py

Frontend

Navigate to frontend folder:

cd frontend


Install dependencies:

npm install


Run the frontend:

npm start

Usage

Open the frontend in your browser (http://localhost:3000).

Speak into the microphone.

The chatbot will respond both in text and voice.

Continue conversation naturally.

Applications

Virtual personal assistant

Accessibility tool for visually impaired users

Interactive learning and tutoring

Voice-enabled customer support

License

This project is open-source under the MIT License.

If you want, I can also make a fully formatted GitHub project structure with all folders, frontend/backend code, and voice integration ready to run.

Do you want me to do that?
